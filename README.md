VMware
======

These python scripts are used for VMware control.

The scripts which init with vmxxx can be used to operate and manage your vms via cmds, such as copy/poweron/poweroff/subvmparameters...and so on.

The other part which init with telnetxxx can be use to login vm and execute cmds.

You can read DOC HOWTO for detail info. Any questions, feel free to contact willcai1984@gmail.com, Thanks!
